# Blinks the Light on a Specific location
In this script:

1.The target GPS coordinates are defined using TARGET_LATITUDE and TARGET_LONGITUDE.

2.The LED channel for blinking is defined using LED_CHANNEL.

3. Blinking parameters are defined, including the blink duration (BLINK_DURATION) and the interval between blinks (BLINK_INTERVAL).

4. The toggleLED function toggles the state of the LED using a variable ledState. It sets the LED channel output to a PWM value that corresponds to either the on or off state of the LED.

5. The checkTargetLocation function checks if the drone's GPS coordinates are within a specified distance of the target location. If the distance is below the threshold, a timer is started to trigger the LED blinking.

6. The main timer is set up to call the checkTargetLocation function every 5 seconds to continuously monitor the drone's location.

Please make sure to replace the placeholder values with your actual target GPS coordinates, LED channel, and blinking parameters. Additionally, adjust the PWM values in the setChannelOutput function to match your LED setup. Test the script in a controlled environment to ensure it behaves as expected on your UAV system.
