# Wait for the button to be pressed for takeoff
In this script:

1. The switch channel for the button is defined using BUTTON_CHANNEL.

2. The threshold value for button press is defined using BUTTON_PRESS_THRESHOLD. This value represents the PWM value that corresponds to a pressed button.

3. Takeoff parameters are defined, including the desired takeoff altitude (TAKEOFF_ALTITUDE).

4. The checkButtonPress function checks the value of the button switch channel using channelInput. If the button value is greater than or equal to the defined threshold, the function initiates takeoff to the specified altitude using the takeoffAltitude function. It also logs a message indicating the takeoff initiation.

5. The main timer is set up to call the checkButtonPress function every 1 second to continuously monitor the button press.

**Remember to replace the placeholder values with your actual switch channel, button press threshold, and takeoff altitude. Also, make sure that the switch channel is correctly configured in your RC transmitter. Test the script in a controlled environment to ensure it behaves as expected in your UAV system.**
