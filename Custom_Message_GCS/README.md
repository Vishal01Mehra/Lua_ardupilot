# Sends custom messages to the Ground Control Station (GCS)
In this script:

1. The SYSID and COMPID values define the system and component IDs for the message. Replace these with appropriate values for your vehicle.

2. The sendCustomMessage function constructs a custom MAVLink message using the mavlink_msg_custom_msg_pack function and sends it to the GCS using mavlink_send_message.

3. The receiveMessages function reads incoming messages using mavlink_read_msg, and if the message ID matches the custom message ID, it decodes and logs the message content.

4. The main timer is set up to call the receiveMessages function every 1 second to check for received messages.

5. Another timer is set up to send a custom message to the GCS every 5 seconds. Adjust the message content as needed.

**This example uses custom message IDs, and you'll need to adjust the message formats and IDs accordingly. Also, make sure that the MAVLink library is properly configured and available in your ArduPilot setup. Test the script in a controlled environment to ensure it communicates with the GCS as expected.**
