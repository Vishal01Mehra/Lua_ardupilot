# Lua Scripts for ArduPilot

Lua scripting in ArduPilot allows for advanced customization and automation of UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) operations. This repository provides examples and resources to help you get started with Lua scripting on your ArduPilot-enabled vehicle.

## Features

- **Monitor Sensors:** Continuously monitor and log sensor data such as GPS, battery voltage, and telemetry.
- **Automate Tasks:** Create automated routines for pre-flight checks, waypoint missions, and emergency responses.
- **Customize Behavior:** Tailor UAV behavior by scripting responses to specific events or conditions.
- **Enhance Telemetry:** Send custom messages and alerts to Ground Control Stations (GCS) based on real-time conditions.
- **Extend Functionality:** Integrate additional hardware or software functionalities through scripting interfaces.

## Getting Started

To start using Lua scripts with ArduPilot, follow these steps:

1. **Setup Environment:** Ensure your ArduPilot firmware supports Lua scripting.
2. **Upload Scripts:** Upload Lua scripts to your vehicle using Mission Planner or another ground station tool.
3. **Configure and Execute:** Configure script parameters and execute scripts as per your UAV's requirements.

## Examples

This repository includes example Lua scripts demonstrating various functionalities such as:

- Basic sensor monitoring
- Automated mission sequences
- Emergency response scripts
