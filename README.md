#Lua Scripts for ArduPilot
Lua scripting in ArduPilot enables advanced customization and automation of UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) operations. With Lua scripts, you can:

Monitor Sensors: Continuously monitor and log sensor data such as GPS, battery voltage, and telemetry.
Automate Tasks: Create automated routines for pre-flight checks, waypoint missions, and emergency responses.
Customize Behavior: Tailor UAV behavior by scripting responses to specific events or conditions.
Enhance Telemetry: Send custom messages and alerts to Ground Control Stations (GCS) based on real-time conditions.
Extend Functionality: Integrate additional hardware or software functionalities through scripting interfaces.
Lua scripts empower users to leverage the flexibility and power of scripting to enhance and customize their ArduPilot-controlled vehicles.
